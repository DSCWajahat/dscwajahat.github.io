# Fahion Classifier
In this project, I classified different fashion items and also I applied EDA on dataset using PCA and t-SNE methods. By using modified LeNet model,I got almost 98% accuracy on classifying items.
# Fahion Recommender
I used modified LeNet to extract features and used them to get similiar fashion products using sklearn nearest neighbours module.
# Four Shapes Classification
In this project, I used modified LeNet CNN to classify different types of shapes and got 99% accuracy.
# Netflix Analysis
This project aims to build a movie recommendation mechanism within Netflix. The dataset I used here come directly from Netflix which can be downloaded rom kaggle.
# Pima Indians Diabetes Analysis
The objective of this project is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset
# UFO Sightings Analysis
I investigated UFO data over the last century to formulate some questions, and gain insight regarding what the answers may be. This is also be a useful notebook on seeing how one may get their brain juices flowing when faced with an unknown dataset.
# Classification Comparisons
The goal of this project was to load a dummy dataset and apply different classification techniques using sklearn and perform EDA and graphs comparisons between the performance of each classification algorithm




## Credit Card Fraud

### What was used:

- Python Programming Language
- Machine-Learning Algorithms

This is a compilation of materials for my first project in the course DSC 680 (Applied Data Science) at Bellevue University. This project aims to build a machine learning model that has the capability to predict, with great accuracy, when a credit card transaction presents as being fraudulent. Beginning with exploratory data analysis, I use machine learning algorithms to understand and work through these data. By exploring the data set and understanding trends, I build and train a model to predict which transactions are fraudulent, ultimately aiming to test and select the most accurate model for this set of data.

### What was used:

- R  Language and its packages such as ggplot2; data.table; reshape2


This project is recommending the system to predict the preference of user in a movie choice in a most effecient way. This system can detect the behaviour of user's  choice and recommend him/her the movie based on his/her preference. Dataaset was provided by MovieLens.

## Customer-Segmentation
<img src="https://cdn.liveagent.com/app/uploads/2019/11/Segmentation-2.png" width="320" height="168" title="Segmentation">
### What was used:

- R  Language and its packages such as ggplot2; data.table; reshape2


Customer segmentation is a process which allows a business to divide their customer base into specific groups based on similarities such as gender, age, shopping habits, and more. Using machine learning algorithms, I plan to segment customers of a shopping mall in this manner. With segmentation, companies can gain a deeper understanding of their user base and meet the specific needs of those groups
