### What was used:

- Python Programming Language
- Machine-Learning Algorithms

This is a compilation of materials for my first project in the course DSC 680 (Applied Data Science) at Bellevue University. This project aims to build a machine learning model that has the capability to predict, with great accuracy, when a credit card transaction presents as being fraudulent. Beginning with exploratory data analysis, I use machine learning algorithms to understand and work through these data. By exploring the data set and understanding trends, I build and train a model to predict which transactions are fraudulent, ultimately aiming to test and select the most accurate model for this set of data.

### What was used:

- R  Language and its packages such as ggplot2; data.table; reshape2


This project is recommending the system to predict the preference of user in a movie choice in a most effecient way. This system can detect the behaviour of user's  choice and recommend him/her the movie based on his/her preference. Dataaset was provided by MovieLens.
